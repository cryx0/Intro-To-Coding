    <h1> About Us</h1>
    <p>Originally a family owned business in Italy, Pizza Palace recently relocated to Goose Creek, SC. This was to provide our customers an opportunity to experience authentic mouth-watering Italian cuisine. Our restaurant offers a delicious assortment of traditional Italian-style pies, pastas, sandwiches, and homemade desserts. All of our selections are made from scratch with fresh, simple ingredients.</p>
